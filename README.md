# Opinionated
Tells you whether a news article is particularly polarized. In a world of confused media, this app makes it easier to angle your consumption towards a more neutral perspective.

Makes all the polarizing words in an article a bright red color so they're easy to spot, and changes the article title's color according to the how polarized the article is (refer to the legend in the extension's page).

Dataset of polarizing matchers taken from the following papers:
